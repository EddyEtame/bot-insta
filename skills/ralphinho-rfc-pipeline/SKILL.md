# Ralphinho RFC Pipeline

Inspired by [humanplane](https://github.com/humanplane) style RFC decomposition patterns and multi-unit orchestration workflows.

Use this skill when a feature is too large for a single agent pass and must be split into independently verifiable work units.

## Pipeline Stages

1. RFC intake
2. DAG decomposition
3. Unit assignment
4. Unit implementation
5. Unit validation
6. Merge queue and integration
7. Final system verification

## Unit Spec Template

Each work unit should include:
- `id`
- `depends_on`
- `scope`
- `acceptance_tests`
- `risk_level`
- `rollback_plan`

## Complexity Tiers

- Tier 1: isolated file edits, deterministic tests
- Tier 2: multi-file behavior changes, moderate integration risk
- Tier 3: schema/auth/perf/security changes

## Quality Pipeline per Unit

1. research
2. implementation plan
3. implementation
4. tests
5. review
6. merge-ready report

## Merge Queue Rules

- Never merge a unit with unresolved dependency failures.
- Always rebase unit branches on latest integration branch.
- Re-run integration tests after each queued merge.

## Recovery

If a unit stalls:
- evict from active queue
- snapshot findings
- regenerate narrowed unit scope
- retry with updated constraints

## Outputs

- RFC execution log
- unit scorecards
- dependency graph snapshot
- integration risk summary
